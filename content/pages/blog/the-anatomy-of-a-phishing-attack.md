Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent and damaging forms of cybercrime today. And the consequences for businesses and employees can be devastating—ranging from crippling data breaches and financial losses to severe damage to a company’s reputation.

According to the FBI’s 2023 Internet Crime Report, phishing was the most common type of cybercrime, with nearly 300,000 incidents reported last year alone.1 Understanding how these attacks work and implementing phishing prevention strategies can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim yourself.

# Analyzing the Structure of a Phishing Attack

Knowledge is power—so let’s go over the basics before diving into some phishing prevention tips. Phishing is a deceptive method employed by cybercriminals to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal details.

Typically, these attacks are carried out by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications, convincing victims to click on malicious links or download harmful attachments. Here’s a breakdown of the typical structure of a phishing attack:

### 1. The Bait

Cybercriminals craft a compelling message designed to entice the recipient to take action. This could be an email, text message, or even a social media post. The bait often involves a sense of urgency, promising rewards or invoking fear to prompt a quick response without allowing the victim to think too much.

### 2. The Hook

Once the bait is set, the attacker includes a link or attachment that appears legitimate but leads to a fraudulent website or downloads malicious software. These websites are designed to mimic legitimate sites closely, tricking users into entering their credentials or downloading harmful files.

### 3. The Catch

When the recipient takes the bait and clicks the link or opens the attachment, they are directed to the fraudulent site. Here, they might be prompted to enter sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details, which the attacker then captures.

### 4. The Haul

With the sensitive information in hand, cybercriminals can use it to commit identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to business networks. The stolen data is often sold on the dark web or used to launch further attacks.
