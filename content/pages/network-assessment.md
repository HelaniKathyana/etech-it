        text: "Our clients come to us because they know their networks could be performing better, and they want us to discover how. That’s why our first step is to conduct a thorough IT audit of their systems so that we can see what they have, how it performs, and how we could improve system efficiency.\n\nWe also recommend a network assessment for any company that doesn’t have complete documentation of their current systems.\_Our complimentary network assessment provides a basic overview of your IT systems, which can help us identify the most immediate concerns, but our comprehensive audit package delivers complete documentation of your systems at the deepest level.\n"

        title: Make the most of your network resources.
        tagline: ''
        subtitle: ''
        text: >
          A sluggish network connection isn’t just irritating for users—it also
          adversely affects business performance, leading to delays and loss of
          productivity. Many businesses assume the source of these delays lies
          in poor bandwidth. However, before you invest your entire IT budget in
          an upgrade, it’s important you gain a fuller picture of how your
          current network allocates resources.


          Running a network assessment allows businesses to identify and
          alleviate bottlenecks, so that the network performs more efficiently.
          By targeting the slow performers that are holding your network back,
          we can optimize your current network before you resort to an upgrade.
          And if it turns out you do need more bandwidth, we can help you find
          the best solution for you business.

        subtitle: Proactive IT Maintenance
        text: >
          It’s not just network bottlenecks that can slow your system down;
          dated hardware or worn out wiring can also have a negative impact on
          performance. But in many cases, businesses don’t know what they have
          or when they purchased it, making it harder to identify which
          components need replacing. As part of our assessment we can create
          documentation for your hardware systems so that you can track the
          lifecycle of your assets and make informed decisions about which to
          upgrade or replace.
