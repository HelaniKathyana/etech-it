        text: >
          Many companies have internal IT staff who have served as loyal
          employees for years. We can work with them to help your IT department
          function more efficiently. Most commonly, we help fill staffing voids
          that arise when a team member falls ill, takes a vacation, or goes on
          parental leave. Or, we can supply an IT specialist to consult on a
          case-by-case basis. We can even take over regular maintenance work so
          as to free the internal resources of your IT department to tackle new
          development initiatives for the company. Whatever you’re looking for,
          we can help you devise a solution.
